\chapter{Introduction}

Get it done!  Use reference material by Lamport~\cite{latex-by-lamport} or
Gooses, Mittelback, and Samarin~\cite{latex-companion}.

\chapter{Doing It}

\section{Getting Ready}

Get all the parts that I need.  I can throw in a whole pile of terms like
preparation\glossary{name={Preparation},description={Getting ready to do something}},
methodology\glossary{name={Methodology},description={The way to do something methodically}},
forethought\glossary{name={Forethought},description={Thinking ahead}},
and
analysis\glossary{name={Analysis},description={Looking back at what you did to see what did or didn't work}}
as examples for me to use in the future.

\section{Next Step}

Do it!

Of course, you have to have pictures to show how you did it to make people
understand things better.

\chapter{Conclusion}

Did it!
